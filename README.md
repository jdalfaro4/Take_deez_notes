## Description
This app is designed to take a note with a title granted to it and save it in a set of logs on the left of the screen so that one could reference their links, plans or events in their upcoming lives. You will be able to delete the notes and create new ones at will. Everyone forgets some important things they have to do or perhaps a date they had or even their facebook login, well now with this notes app they can worry no more. 

This app was the latest and greatest in improving my skills in backend coding. Connect routes through files and establishing proper get commands are forcing me to pay even more attention to detail then I had before. Any detail that doesn't match ever single file creates a headache of problems for deployment. I have learned through this note taking app that all of this specificity is crucial for deploying a working app.
